# Ripaw 

Ripaw is a Flask - React fullstack clone of many different parts of common banking apps. It was built to act as a way for me to practice engaging with data and presenting it in more meaningful ways to a customer. The longterm learning intention is to develop the skills required to show a potential future employer that I can interact with and manipulate data in meaningful ways.
